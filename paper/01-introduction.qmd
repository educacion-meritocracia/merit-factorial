# Introduction

Despite rising economic inequality and limited social mobility in contemporary societies [@chancel_world_2022; @lopez-roldan_comparative_2021], meritocratic beliefs remain remarkably high among citizens [@mijs_paradox_2019; @sandel_tyranny_2020]. The belief that economic disparities are justified by differences in meritocratic elements— such as individual effort and talent [@young_rise_1958]—has been identified as a key mechanism to explain the persistence of inequalities. Educational institutions have played a central role in promoting these beliefs due to their historical association with the promise of mobility and opportunity [@dubet_repensar_2011; @batruch_belief_2022]. Yet, research increasingly shows that schools often reproduce rather than reduce social inequalities [@bourdieu_reproduction_1990; @goudeau_hidden_2017a]. This contradiction has drawn attention to the role of schools in fostering meritocratic beliefs that operate as system-justifying ideologies, obscuring structural disadvantages [@jost_psychology_2003; @wiederkehr_belief_2015; @lampert_meritocratic_2013]. Therefore, understanding how young people perceive and endorse these beliefs is crucial, as they shape educational experiences and reinforce broader narratives about fairness and inequality.

While meritocracy is often defined as a system in which rewards are distributed based on individual merit—namely, effort and ability [@young_rise_1958]—its conceptualization in empirical research remains fragmented. Across disciplines, meritocratic beliefs have been measured through diverse constructs, ranging from general attitudes about social mobility and distributive justice to implicit ideas about success and individual responsibility [@trump_when_2020; @castillo_meritocracia_2019]. Most instruments rely on single-dimension items or fail to distinguish between descriptive and normative components of meritocratic reasoning. Moreover, few tools capture non-meritocratic logics—such as the perceived role of social origin, family wealth, or connections—in shaping outcomes [e.g. @kunovich_systems_2007a; @reynolds_perceptions_2014]. This heterogeneity in conceptual and operational definitions hinders comparative research and limits the capacity to assess how individuals, especially in younger ages, interpret and internalize meritocracy. Addressing this measurement gap is particularly relevant in educational settings, where such beliefs are first socialized and may have long-term implications for attitudes toward inequality and justice [ @batruch_belief_2022; @elenbaas_unfairness_2019a].

Facing the challenges in conceptualization and measurement of meritocratic beliefs, Castillo et al. [-@castillo_multidimensional_2023] proposed a conceptual and measurement model from a multidimensional perspective. This work distinguishes between two dimensions of meritocratic beliefs: perceptions (how individuals think meritocracy operates in practice) and preferences (how they think it should operate). Although this  approach has found support in adult population, so far it has not been applied to younger populations, particularly in educational contexts. Against this background, and with the aim of contributing to empirical research on the early formation of meritocratic beliefs [@elenbaas_unfairness_2019a; @batruch_belief_2022], this study seeks to extend the work of Castillo et al. [-@castillo_multidimensional_2023] by evaluating the applicability of their conceptual and measurement framework among school-aged populations in Chile. Specifically, it assesses whether perceptions and preferences regarding meritocratic and non-meritocratic principles are stable across age cohorts, and consistent over time. By focusing on early adolescence—a formative stage for civic and moral socialization—this study explores how distributive beliefs emerge, develop, and potentially consolidate within school settings.

This study focuses on Chile, a particularly relevant context for examining meritocracy in education. Despite sustained economic growth and poverty reduction, Chile remains one of the most unequal countries in Latin America and the OECD [@chancel_world_2022; @flores_top_2020], partly rooted in neoliberal reforms that turned education into a competitive market [@madariaga_three_2020; @boccardo_30_2020]. Implemented during the dictatorship and expanded in democracy, these reforms institutionalized school choice and public-private competition, generating a highly stratified and segregated educational system [@corvalan_mercado_2017]. While public discontent has driven important reforms, meritocratic narratives remain deeply embedded in students’ understandings of success and fairness [@canalesceron_sujeto_2021].
