# Introduction

Despite rising economic inequality and limited social mobility in contemporary societies [@chancel_world_2025; @lopez-roldan_comparative_2021], meritocratic beliefs remain remarkably high among citizens [@mijs_paradox_2019; @sandel_tyranny_2020]. Meritocracy refers to the idea that economic disparities are (and should be) justified by differences in individual effort and talent rather than social background or connections [@young_rise_1958]. Because schools are historically tied to the promise of opportunity and mobility, educational institutions play a central role in socializing these beliefs [@dubet_repensar_2011; @batruch_belief_2022]. Yet a growing body of research shows that schooling often reproduces, rather than reduces, social inequalities through stratification and unequal learning environments [@bourdieu_reproduction_1990; @goudeau_hidden_2017a; @zhou_equalization_2019]. This tension has drawn attention to schools as key sites where meritocratic beliefs can operate as system-justifying ideologies. By framing outcomes as fair reflections of merit, such beliefs may obscure structural disadvantages and legitimize existing hierarchies [@jost_psychology_2003; @wiederkehr_belief_2015; @lampert_meritocratic_2013]. Understanding how young people perceive and endorse meritocratic beliefs is therefore crucial, not only because these beliefs shape students’ educational experiences, but also because they may consolidate broader narratives about fairness and inequality early in the life course.

Despite this relevance, empirical research on meritocratic beliefs remains conceptually and operationally fragmented. Across disciplines, measures have ranged from broad attitudes toward social mobility and distributive justice to more implicit conceptions of success and individual responsibility [@trump_when_2020; @castillo_meritocracia_2019]. Many instruments rely on single-dimensional items and often blur an essential distinction between descriptive perceptions (how individuals think the system works) and normative preferences (how individuals think it should work). Moreover, few tools capture non-meritocratic logics, such as the perceived influence of social origin, family wealth, or connections, in shaping educational and life outcomes [e.g., @kunovich_systems_2007a; @reynolds_perceptions_2014]. This heterogeneity limits cumulative knowledge: without instruments that separate core dimensions of meritocratic reasoning, it becomes difficult to compare groups, interpret developmental differences, or assess whether longitudinal changes reflect substantive shifts rather than measurement artifacts. In educational settings, where these beliefs are learned, negotiated, and reinforced, the measurement problem is particularly consequential [@batruch_belief_2022; @elenbaas_unfairness_2019a].

To address these challenges, Castillo et al. [-@castillo_multidimensional_2023] proposed a multidimensional conceptual and measurement framework that distinguishes between (a) perceptions and preferences, and (b) meritocratic and non-meritocratic principles. While this approach has received support in adult populations, it has not yet been tested among school-aged students, especially within everyday school contexts. Building on research on the early formation of distributive beliefs and fairness judgments [@elenbaas_unfairness_2019a; @batruch_belief_2022], this paper extends Castillo et al.’s framework to early adolescence in Chile. Our research question is: Do school-aged students distinguish between meritocratic and non-meritocratic principles, and between perceptions (“what is”) and preferences (“what should be”)? Additionally, can these dimensions be measured in ways that are comparable across age cohorts and consistent over time? We argue that applying this multidimensional structure to students clarifies precisely what they endorse: whether they are describing how the system operates, expressing a normative ideal, or combining both. In turn, this provides a stronger basis for studying how fairness beliefs develop and how they may support the legitimation of inequality within schooling.

Chile offers a particularly relevant context for examining the measurement and structure of meritocratic beliefs in education. Despite sustained economic growth and poverty reduction, Chile remains one of the most unequal countries in Latin America and the OECD [@chancel_world_2022; @flores_top_2020], and its educational system has been strongly shaped by neoliberal reforms that transformed schooling into a competitive market [@madariaga_three_2020; @ferre_welfare_2023]. These reforms institutionalized school choice and public–private competition, contributing to a highly stratified and segregated educational landscape [@corvalan_mercado_2017]. At the same time, meritocratic narratives remain salient in students' interpretations of success, effort, and fairness within schools [REFS]. In this setting, testing whether perceptions and preferences regarding meritocratic and non-meritocratic principles can be reliably distinguished and whether they are comparable across age cohorts and over time strengthens empirical research on how school experiences shape beliefs about deservingness, opportunity, and inequality.
