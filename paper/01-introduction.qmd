# Introduction

Despite rising economic inequality, wealth concentration, and declining social mobility in contemporary societies [@chancel_world_2022; @lopez-roldan_comparative_2021], meritocratic beliefs remain remarkably stable among citizens [@mijs_paradox_2019]. The notion that economic disparities are justified by differences in individual effort and talent [@young_rise_1958] has been identified as a key mechanism for legitimizing persistent inequalities. Educational institutions have played a central role in promoting these beliefs due to their historical association with the promise of mobility and opportunity [@dubet_repensar_2011; @batruch_belief_2022]. Yet, research increasingly shows that schools often reproduce rather than reduce social inequalities [@bourdieu_reproduction_1990; @goudeau_hidden_2017a]. This contradiction has drawn attention to the role of schools in fostering meritocratic beliefs that operate as system-justifying ideologies, obscuring structural disadvantages [@jost_psychology_2003; @wiederkehr_belief_2015]. Understanding how young people perceive and endorse these beliefs is crucial, as they shape educational experiences and reinforce broader narratives about fairness and inequality.

Meritocracy is typically understood as a distributive system in which rewards are allocated based on individual merit—namely, effort and ability [@young_rise_1958]. Framed as a means to overcome ascriptive inequalities, meritocracy is often linked to ideals of fairness and equal opportunity, enabling individuals to advance based on merit rather than social origin [@goldthorpe_myth_2003a; @mijs_unfulfillable_2016]. However, several scholars argue that meritocracy may in fact legitimize inequality, insofar as it promotes an outcome-based hierarchy where those already advantaged are more likely to succeed [@castillo_socialization_2024]. Studies in sociology and psychology show that belief in meritocracy correlates with stronger individual attributions of success, lower support for redistribution, and greater tolerance for inequality [@madeira_primes_2019; @newman_economic_2023; @trump_when_2020; @castillo_meritocracia_2019]. These critiques question the validity of meritocracy as a moral ideal, given the persistent influence of non-meritocratic factors—such as family background or economic capital—on life chances [@garcia-sierra_dark_2023; @witteveen_reconsidering_2020; @markovits_meritocracy_2019].

Due to the role that meritocratic beliefs play in the justification of individual achievement (or failure) in contemporary societies, schools are central sites for the socialization of meritocratic beliefs, promoting the idea that academic success depends primarily on effort and talent [@wiederkehr_belief_2015; @batruch_belief_2022; @erivwo_meritocracy_2021]. This belief not only sustains the school’s selective function but also reinforces broader narratives of individual responsibility and fairness. Research has shown that belief in school meritocracy is associated with greater acceptance of social and economic inequalities [@darnon_where_2018; @batruch_belief_2022; @castillo_socialization_2024], suggesting that schools contribute not only to the reproduction but also to the legitimation of inequality. In highly stratified systems like Chile’s, this discourse may obscure the effects of social origin on educational outcomes [@goudeau_hidden_2017a]. 

Although there is growing interest in meritocracy, concepts and instruments for measuring it vary substantially across the literature, making it difficult to assess how individuals actually understand and evaluate meritocratic principles. To address this gap, Castillo et al. [-@castillo_multidimensional_2023] propose a conceptual and measurement framework that distinguishes between two dimensions of meritocratic beliefs: perceptions (how individuals think meritocracy operates in practice) and preferences (how they think it should operate). The framework also differentiates between meritocratic factors—such as effort and ability—and non-meritocratic ones, including social contacts or coming from a wealthy family. Based on these distinctions, the authors developed a short, multidimensional scale, which they applied and validated in a representative sample of Chilean adults. Their findings show that perceptions and preferences regarding meritocratic and non-meritocratic elements are distinct yet interrelated, coexisting in complex ways.

Against this background, and with the aim of contributing to empirical research on the early formation of meritocratic beliefs [@elenbaas_unfairness_2019a; @batruch_belief_2022], this study seeks to extend the work of Castillo et al. [-@castillo_multidimensional_2023] by evaluating the applicability of their conceptual and measurement framework among school-aged populations in Chile. Specifically, it assesses whether perceptions and preferences regarding meritocratic and non-meritocratic principles are empirically distinguishable, stable across age cohorts, and consistent over time. By focusing on early adolescence—a formative stage for civic and moral socialization—this study explores how distributive beliefs emerge, develop, and potentially consolidate within school settings.

This study focuses on Chile, a particularly relevant context for examining meritocracy in education. Despite sustained economic growth and poverty reduction, Chile remains one of the most unequal countries in Latin America and the OECD [@chancel_world_2022; @flores_top_2020], partly rooted in neoliberal reforms that turned education into a competitive market [@madariaga_three_2020; @boccardo_30_2020]. Implemented during the dictatorship and expanded in democracy, these reforms institutionalized school choice and public-private competition, generating a highly stratified and segregated educational system [@corvalan_mercado_2017]. While public discontent has driven important reforms, meritocratic narratives remain deeply embedded in students’ understandings of success and fairness [@canalesceron_sujeto_2021].

We address the following research questions: (1) To what extent do Chilean students perceive and prefer meritocratic and non-meritocratic principles in education? (2) Are these beliefs stable across age cohorts and over time? To explore these questions, we draw on panel survey data collected in 2023 and 2024 from students aged 13 and 14 (N = 512). The following sections present the theoretical framework, describe the data and methods, and report the findings from confirmatory factor analysis and measurement invariance testing. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for the study of socialization, education, and inequality.
