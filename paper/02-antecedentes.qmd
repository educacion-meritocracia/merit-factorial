# Theoretical and empirical background

## Meritocratic perceptions and preferences

Meritocracy is often understood as a normative principle that justifies the allocation of rewards and opportunities based on effort and talent. Originally proposed by @young_rise_1958 in his dystopian novel, the concept was intended to critique a social order in which power is justified by achievement and social mobility mainly drive by merit. Despite this critical origin, meritocracy has been widely accepted as a principle of equity: the idea that people should be rewarded based on their effort and talent, rather than inherited privileges [@vandewerfhorst_meritocracy_2024]. However, as @sandel_tyranny_2020 argues, the promise of meritocracy often becomes a source of inequality, as those who succeed are encouraged to believe they deserve it, while those who fail are forced to internalize the blame. Rather than mitigating inequality, meritocratic ideals can reinforce it by disguising structural disadvantage as a personal deficiency [@mijs_unfulfillable_2016].

Recent research has emphasized the need to decompose the term of "meritocratic beliefs", distinguish between meritocratic preferences and meritocratic perceptions [@castillo_multidimensional_2023]. While preferences refer to normative ideas about how social rewards should be allocated based on merit (which should be the case), perceptions refer to subjective evaluations of how meritocracy operates in society (which is the case). This distinction allows for a more precise understanding of how people interpret inequality: they may regard merit as an ideal, while recognizing that society's institutions often fail to deliver on this promise. In stratified societies, this gap between preferences and perceptions becomes particularly evident. People may continue to normatively believe in meritocracy even in the face of evidence that opportunities are unequally distributed [@mijs_paradox_2019]. Moreover, experimental evidence shows that making the unobserved potential of less fortunate individuals visible can reduce winners’ self-perceived deservingness and increase their willingness to redistribute, underscoring the interplay between perceptions of justice and redistribution [@wiese_unveiling_2025].

Several empirical studies have examined the social foundations and consequences of meritocratic beliefs, particularly among adult populations. Consistent findings indicate that individuals with higher levels of education, income, and occupational prestige are more likely to endorse meritocratic explanations for social outcomes [@garcia-sanchez_perceptions_2018; @mijs_paradox_2019]. These beliefs are not merely cognitive assessments or moral evaluations; they carry substantial implications for how people perceive fairness and redistribution. Individuals who view society as rewarding merit tend to justify existing inequalities and are less inclined to support redistributive policies [@reynolds_perceptions_2014; @hauser_misperceptions_2017]. Recent research further shows that exposure to meritocratic narratives reinforces the belief that poverty stems from individual failings rather than structural conditions, thereby decreasing support for redistribution and increasing the stigmatization of the poor [@hoyt_mindsets_2023]. This dynamic contributes to the persistence of negative stereotypes and diminishes empathy toward those from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. Moreover, Busemeyer et al. [@busemeyer_positive_2021] argue that meritocratic narratives function as feedback mechanisms that shape public opinion and subjective well-being by framing welfare outcomes as deserved or undeserved within existing institutional frameworks. In doing so, meritocratic beliefs shift responsibility for success or failure onto individuals, obscure the role of structural factors, and ultimately reinforce the legitimacy of the status quo.

## The socialization of meritocracy: families and schools

Socialization refers to the process by which individuals internalize social norms, values, and practices, thereby acquiring the dispositions necessary to function in society. Far from being neutral, this process is rooted in structures of power and inequality. From a sociological perspective, @bourdieu_sentido_2007 conceptualizes socialization as an orientation that shapes individuals' perceptions and actions, often without their conscious awareness. In a complementary manner, @bandura_sociallearning_1969 emphasizes the role of social learning, through which children adopt patterns of behavior and value systems modeled by their families. Therefore, the internalization of meritocratic beliefs—such as the idea that effort and talent are the primary determinants of success—is not simply a rational decision, but the result of deep, structured, and class-dependent socialization processes.

Families play a fundamental role in shaping meritocratic orientations. Parenting practices reflect social class strategies aimed at preserving or enhancing social status [@bourdieu_reproduction_1990; @bernstein_theoretical_2005]. Higher-status families tend to transmit symbolic-relational values such as autonomy, self-expression, and personal responsibility, closely aligned with the meritocratic ideals promoted in schools [@santanderramirez_preferencias_2020]. On the other hand, families from disadvantaged backgrounds may emphasize discipline, effort, and obedience; values that are also meritocratic, but often dissociated from the institutional resources necessary to achieve upward mobility. Through explicit discourse and lived experience, children absorb messages about success, fairness, and responsibility, which often reflect their parents' attitudes and expectations [@bandura_sociallearning_1969].

The Chilean educational system offers a unique setting for examining the school-based socialization of meritocratic beliefs. As one of the most market-driven educational systems in the world, Chile has experienced decades of neoliberal reform that reshaped its educational landscape around principles of privatization, competition, and individual responsibility [@madariaga_three_2020; @boccardo_30_2020]. Introduced during the military dictatorship (1973-1989) and consolidated under democratic governments, this model relies on public subsidies to families, a strong presence of private providers, and mechanisms that stratify access based on socioeconomic background [@bellei_estudio_2013; @valenzuela_socioeconomic_2013]. In this context, schools are not merely sites of learning but also institutional spaces where students are exposed to—and absorb—norms of competition, performance, and accountability. These conditions not only entrench structural inequalities but also foster a cultural environment in which individual success is interpreted as the outcome of merit, obscuring the influence of unequal starting points [@dubet_repensar_2011].

Central to this process is the school-based dissemination of meritocratic beliefs—understood as the idea that effort and talent should determine educational outcomes and future opportunities. In the school context, the distinction between preferences and perceptions is crucial: students may endorse merit as a fair principle for distributing rewards while simultaneously doubting whether their school environment truly operates under such ideals. Empirical studies in Chile show that students who affirm the importance of effort and intelligence for achieving good grades (i.e., high meritocratic preferences), yet they are more ambivalent about whether these criteria are fairly applied in society and school (i.e., perceptions) [@castillo_socialization_2024]. This gap reveals how the school simultaneously cultivates belief in meritocratic ideals and reproduces the very inequities that challenge their validity.

Schools play a central role in reinforcing these beliefs through mechanisms of classification, evaluation, and public recognition. Grades, awards, and distinctions function as institutional markers of “merit”, shaping students’ understanding of achievement as individually earned rather than socially conditioned [@resh_sense_2014]. This framing often leads students—regardless of their social background—to attribute academic success or failure to personal effort, reinforcing individualistic explanations and limiting awareness of structural barriers [@darnon_where_2018]. As @lampert_meritocratic_2013 notes, the meritocratic school systematically rewards a minority while instilling in the majority a sense of personal failure and worthlessness. Despite this, children and adolescents—even from disadvantaged backgrounds—frequently internalize meritocratic narratives, suggesting that school-based exposure is a powerful force in shaping students’ beliefs about inequality and justice [@henry_development_2006].

The consequences of this meritocratic socialization extend beyond the classroom. As shown by @castillo_socialization_2024, students who perceive higher levels of meritocracy in their schools—particularly those who believe that effort and talent are justly rewarded—are more likely to justify unequal access to education, healthcare, and pensions based on individuals’ economic means. These market justice preferences reflect a broader tendency to accept or legitimize inequality as a fair outcome of differential contributions. Notably, these associations are strongest in high-status schools, where academic performance and social privilege are more prevalent. This suggests that school environments not only shape academic trajectories but also contribute to the cultural reproduction of inequality by reinforcing ideological support for market-based distributive logics. In this way, the school emerges as a central institution in the moral economy of neoliberal societies: one that not only sorts individuals by performance but also legitimates the stratification it helps to produce.

## The Chilean Educational Context: Marketization and Segregation

Chile represents a paradigmatic case of neoliberal educational reform in Latin America, characterized by extensive privatization and market-based mechanisms that have profoundly shaped its educational landscape. Following reforms introduced during the civil-military dictatorship (1973–1989) and expanded throughout the democratic period, Chile developed one of the most marketized school systems globally, where access to quality education is heavily stratified by socioeconomic status and payment capacity [@boccardo_30_2020; @madariaga_three_2020]. The Chilean educational system operates through three administrative categories: public schools (30.6% of enrollment), state-subsidized private voucher schools (54.0%), and fully private schools (9.3%), with the latter predominantly serving higher-income families [@castillo_socialization_2024]. This tripartite structure emerged from the 1980s voucher reform, which introduced market competition by allowing families to choose schools and providing per-student subsidies to both public and private institutions. While intended to improve quality through competition, the system has instead reinforced socioeconomic segregation, as schools select students and families sort themselves based on ability to pay additional fees and navigate the educational marketplace [@torche_intergenerational_2014].

This institutional design has created a highly stratified educational environment where school socioeconomic composition strongly predicts both academic outcomes and student experiences. The Chilean education system exhibits severe difficulties in closing socioeconomic and cultural gaps of origin, with schools serving as sites of social reproduction rather than mobility [@bourdieu_reproduction_1990]. Despite some upward mobility into intermediate classes being feasible, access to elite educational opportunities—and subsequently elite social strata—remains largely restricted by family background [@lopez-roldan_comparative_2021; @torche_intergenerational_2014]. Within this context, meritocratic discourse has become particularly salient, with schools promoting values and narratives that emphasize individual effort and talent as the primary determinants of academic success, often obscuring the structural advantages that higher-status students bring to educational settings [@castillo_socialization_2024].

Chile's educational marketization is part of a broader pattern of neoliberal reforms that have commodified essential services across multiple domains. Following the dictatorship-era restructuring, health, pensions, and education have all become areas where provision and access are managed substantially through private entities and segmented by individual payment capacity [@boccardo_30_2020; @ffrench-davis_reformas_2018]. Despite steady economic expansion, Chile continues to rank among the most unequal nations in the OECD, with the poorest 50% receiving only 8.2% of total income while the richest 1% receives almost 27% of income and holds 36.6% of wealth [@chancel_world_2025; @flores_top_2020]. This acute economic inequality coexists with widespread belief in individual responsibility for economic outcomes—a phenomenon documented across Latin America but particularly pronounced in Chile [@bucca_merit_2016; @mac-clure_justicia_2024].

The tension between high inequality and individualistic explanations of success came to a head in October 2019, when massive social protests erupted across Chile. Initially sparked by high school students protesting transportation fare increases, the mobilizations quickly expanded to broader demands for equality of opportunities, particularly regarding access to quality education, healthcare, and pensions [@somma_no_2021]. These protests revealed deep dissatisfaction with the commodification of social services and challenged dominant meritocratic narratives, though subsequent research suggests that fundamental attitudes toward market-based distribution may have proven resilient even in the face of these collective political events [@castillo_perceptions_2025].

This highly stratified and marketized educational context provides a particularly relevant setting for examining how students develop attitudes toward economic inequality and market-based distribution. Students in Chile are socialized within institutions that simultaneously promote meritocratic ideals while operating according to market logics that explicitly segment access by payment capacity. Research indicates that Chilean students exhibit substantial support for market justice principles—justifying unequal access to healthcare, education, and pensions based on income—at rates higher than those observed in adult populations [@castillo_socialization_2024].

Understanding how the Chilean educational context shapes these attitudes requires attention to both family and school socialization processes, the role of meritocratic perceptions, and the institutional features that normalize market-based inequalities. The meritocratic framing prevalent in Chilean schools treats academic achievement as the outcome of individual effort and talent rather than as the result of differential access to resources and opportunities, potentially legitimizing broader patterns of social and economic inequality [@darnon_where_2018]. This context makes Chile an ideal case for examining the interplay between educational experiences, meritocratic beliefs, and preferences for market justice.
