## Meritocratic perceptions and preferences


## Meritocratic perceptions and preferences at school

The Chilean educational system offers a unique setting for examining the school-based socialization of meritocratic beliefs. As one of the most market-driven educational systems in the world, Chile has experienced decades of neoliberal reform that reshaped its educational landscape around principles of privatization, competition, and individual responsibility. Introduced during the military dictatorship and consolidated under democratic governments, this model relies on public subsidies to families, a strong presence of private providers, and mechanisms that stratify access based on socioeconomic background [@bellei_estudio_2013; @valenzuela_socioeconomic_2013]. In this context, schools are not merely sites of learning but also institutional spaces where students are exposed to—and absorb—norms of competition, performance, and accountability. These conditions not only entrench structural inequalities but also foster a cultural environment in which individual success is interpreted as the outcome of merit, obscuring the influence of unequal starting points.

Central to this process is the school-based dissemination of meritocratic beliefs—understood as the idea that effort and talent should determine educational outcomes and future opportunities. Recent research has emphasized the importance of distinguishing between two dimensions of such beliefs: preferences and perceptions (Castillo et al., 2019; Resh, 2017). Meritocratic preferences refer to normative commitments—what individuals believe should be the case—while perceptions refer to evaluative judgments—what individuals believe actually occurs in practice. 

In the school context, the distinction between preferences and perceptions is crucial: students may endorse merit as a fair principle for distributing rewards while simultaneously doubting whether their school environment truly operates under such ideals. Empirical studies in Chile show that students who affirm the importance of effort and intelligence for achieving good grades (i.e., high meritocratic preferences), yet they are more ambivalent about whether these criteria are fairly applied in society and school (i.e., perceptions) [@castillo_socialization_2024]. This gap reveals how the school simultaneously cultivates belief in meritocratic ideals and reproduces the very inequities that challenge their validity.

Schools play a central role in reinforcing these beliefs through mechanisms of classification, evaluation, and public recognition. Grades, awards, and distinctions function as institutional markers of “merit”, shaping students’ understanding of achievement as individually earned rather than socially conditioned [@resh_sense_2014]. This framing often leads students—regardless of their social background—to attribute academic success or failure to personal effort, reinforcing individualistic explanations and limiting awareness of structural barriers [@darnon_where_2018]. As @lampert_meritocratic_2013 notes, the meritocratic school systematically rewards a minority while instilling in the majority a sense of personal failure and worthlessness. Despite this, children and adolescents—even from disadvantaged backgrounds—frequently internalize meritocratic narratives, suggesting that school-based exposure is a powerful force in shaping students’ beliefs about inequality and justice [@henry_development_2006].

The consequences of this meritocratic socialization extend beyond the classroom. As shown by @castillo_socialization_2024, students who perceive higher levels of meritocracy in their schools—particularly those who believe that effort and talent are justly rewarded—are more likely to justify unequal access to education, healthcare, and pensions based on individuals’ economic means. These market justice preferences reflect a broader tendency to accept or legitimize inequality as a fair outcome of differential contributions. Notably, these associations are strongest in high-status schools, where academic performance and social privilege are more prevalent. This suggests that school environments not only shape academic trajectories but also contribute to the cultural reproduction of inequality by reinforcing ideological support for market-based distributive logics. In this way, the school emerges as a central institution in the moral economy of neoliberal societies: one that not only sorts individuals by performance but also legitimates the stratification it helps to produce.
