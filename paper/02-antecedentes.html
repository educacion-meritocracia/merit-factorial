<section id="meritocratic-perceptions-and-preferences" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="meritocratic-perceptions-and-preferences">Meritocratic perceptions and preferences</h2>
<p>Meritocracy refers to a distributive system in which individual merit—typically defined as effort and talent—is treated as the primary criterion for allocating resources and rewards, rather than social origins or inherited privilege <span class="citation" data-cites="young_rise_1958 bell_equality_1972">(<a href="#ref-bell_equality_1972" role="doc-biblioref">Bell, 1972</a>; <a href="#ref-young_rise_1958" role="doc-biblioref">Young, 1958</a>)</span>. While <span class="citation" data-cites="young_rise_1958">Young (<a href="#ref-young_rise_1958" role="doc-biblioref">1958</a>)</span> coined the term as a dystopian critique of a society that justifies power and status through “achievement,” it has since been re-appropriated as a positive ideal of fairness, especially in liberal and market-oriented societies <span class="citation" data-cites="dubet_repensar_2011 mijs_paradox_2019 vandewerfhorst_meritocracy_2024">(<a href="#ref-dubet_repensar_2011" role="doc-biblioref">Dubet, 2011</a>; <a href="#ref-mijs_paradox_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Mijs, 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-vandewerfhorst_meritocracy_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Van De Werfhorst, 2024</a>)</span>. From a sociological standpoint, meritocracy is not only a cognitive judgement about how inequality works; it is also a moral lens through which people interpret differences in income, status, and life chances <span class="citation" data-cites="castillo_meritocracia_2019">(<a href="#ref-castillo_meritocracia_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Castillo et al., 2019</a>)</span>. Precisely because it frames outcomes as earned, meritocratic ideals can end up reinforcing inequality: “winners” are encouraged to see their position as deserved, while “losers” are pushed toward self-blame rather than structural critique <span class="citation" data-cites="wilson_role_2003 mijs_stratified_2016 sandel_tyranny_2020">(<a href="#ref-mijs_stratified_2016" role="doc-biblioref">Mijs, 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-sandel_tyranny_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Sandel, 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-wilson_role_2003" role="doc-biblioref">Wilson, 2003</a>)</span>. The key point is that meritocracy often promises to mitigate inherited advantage, but in practice, it can legitimize unequal structures by translating social privilege into individualized narratives of deservingness.</p>
<p>A significant limitation in the extant literature is the way “meritocratic beliefs” have been measured in survey studies. As <span class="citation" data-cites="castillo_multidimensional_2023">Castillo et al. (<a href="#ref-castillo_multidimensional_2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> argues, most research relies on item batteries that assess the importance of effort, talent, family background, networks, or luck for “getting ahead” and then reduces these factors to a single score. This becomes especially problematic when researchers construct a difference or continuum measure—treating meritocratic and non-meritocratic explanations as opposite ends of the same scale (e.g., by subtracting “non-merit” from “merit,” as in the <span class="citation" data-cites="reynolds_perceptions_2014">Reynolds &amp; Xian (<a href="#ref-reynolds_perceptions_2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> approach). The underlying assumption is that endorsing merit must imply rejecting structural or relational advantages, leaving the possibility of the coexistence of apparently opposed beliefs out of empirical test. Recent work has explicitly raised this issue: <span class="citation" data-cites="liu_does_2025">Liu &amp; Wang (<a href="#ref-liu_does_2025" role="doc-biblioref">2025</a>)</span> emphasizes that meritocratic endorsement may be stable while recognition of structural constraints changes; <span class="citation" data-cites="tang_meritocratic_2025">Tang et al. (<a href="#ref-tang_meritocratic_2025" role="doc-biblioref">2025</a>)</span> motivates “dual consciousness” but still risks obscuring it when operationalizations force relative trade-offs; and <span class="citation" data-cites="zhu_meritocratic_2025">Zhu (<a href="#ref-zhu_meritocratic_2025" role="doc-biblioref">2025</a>)</span> argues directly that meritocratic and structural explanations are not zero-sum, but often accumulate rather than replace one another. The measurement implication is essential but straightforward: if people can simultaneously believe that effort matters and that family resources or connections matter, then unidimensional indices (and especially subtraction scores) can manufacture artificial “neutral” positions and blur substantively distinct belief profiles.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="castillo_multidimensional_2023">Castillo et al. (<a href="#ref-castillo_multidimensional_2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> address these problems by decomposing “meritocratic beliefs” along two analytically independent axes: preferences versus perceptions, and meritocratic versus non-meritocratic allocation principles. Preferences capture normative ideals about how rewards should be distributed (e.g., whether effort and ability ought to determine life chances). In contrast, perceptions capture descriptive evaluations of how society actually works (e.g., whether observed inequalities reflect merit-based processes) <span class="citation" data-cites="janmaat_subjective_2013">(<a href="#ref-janmaat_subjective_2013" role="doc-biblioref">Janmaat, 2013</a>)</span>. In parallel, the framework conceptualizes meritocratic elements (e.g., effort, talent) and non-meritocratic elements (e.g., social origins, inherited privilege, networks) as distinct components rather than as opposite poles of a single continuum. This yields four non-redundant constructs—meritocratic preferences, meritocratic perceptions, non-meritocratic preferences, and non-meritocratic perceptions—thus allowing combinations that older measures tend to collapse, such as endorsing meritocracy as an ideal while recognizing the weight of family background and connections. A practical advantage of this instrument is its minimalist design, which makes it well-suited for large-scale surveys with limited questionnaire space; however, this parsimony entails a trade-off, as each factor is measured with only two items, potentially constraining reliability and content coverage relative to longer batteries. In the adult population in Chile, the authors show that respondents differentiate among these dimensions and that these dimensions are systematically related; for instance, stronger perceptions that non-meritocratic factors are rewarded tend to co-occur with stronger preferences for meritocratic allocation. This configuration aligns with Zhu’s <span class="citation" data-cites="zhu_meritocratic_2025">(<a href="#ref-zhu_meritocratic_2025" role="doc-biblioref">2025</a>)</span> “dual consciousness,” here specified as the coexistence of (a) meritocratic and non-meritocratic beliefs and (b) legitimacy judgments (“should”) alongside descriptive assessments (“is”).</p>
<p>Research in adult populations has mapped both the determinants and consequences of meritocratic perceptions. On the “causes” side, higher-status individuals —those with more education, income, and occupational prestige—and upward mobile individuals are consistently more likely to endorse merit-based explanations for social outcomes <span class="citation" data-cites="duru-bellat_whos_2012 garcia-sanchez_perceptions_2018 mijs_belief_2022 traini_climbing_2025">(<a href="#ref-duru-bellat_whos_2012" role="doc-biblioref">Duru-Bellat &amp; Tenret, 2012</a>; <a href="#ref-garcia-sanchez_perceptions_2018" role="doc-biblioref">García-Sánchez et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-mijs_belief_2022" role="doc-biblioref">Mijs et al., 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-traini_climbing_2025" role="doc-biblioref">Traini et al., 2025</a>)</span>. On the “consequences” side, perceiving one’s society as meritocratic is associated with lower support for redistribution and egalitarian policies <span class="citation" data-cites="hoyt_mindsets_2023 tejero-peregrina_perceived_2025 paneda-fernandez_relevance_2026">(<a href="#ref-hoyt_mindsets_2023" role="doc-biblioref">Hoyt et al., 2023</a>; <a href="#ref-paneda-fernandez_relevance_2026" role="doc-biblioref">Pañeda-Fernández et al., 2026</a>; <a href="#ref-tejero-peregrina_perceived_2025" role="doc-biblioref">Tejero-Peregrina et al., 2025</a>)</span>, as well as greater acceptance of inequality and market-based allocation logics <span class="citation" data-cites="castillo_meritocracia_2019 castillo_perceptions_2025">(<a href="#ref-castillo_perceptions_2025" role="doc-biblioref">Castillo et al., 2025</a>, <a href="#ref-castillo_meritocracia_2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>. Experimental evidence is consistent with a causal pathway in which exposure to upward-mobility information or “self-made” narratives reduces redistributive support and increases tolerance of inequality and system-justifying orientations, whereas exposure to low or downward mobility produces the opposite pattern—effects that are often partly mediated by strengthened meritocratic perceptions <span class="citation" data-cites="deng_its_2025 matamoros-lima_social_2025">(<a href="#ref-deng_its_2025" role="doc-biblioref">Deng &amp; Wang, 2025</a>; <a href="#ref-matamoros-lima_social_2025" role="doc-biblioref">Matamoros-Lima et al., 2025</a>)</span>. Taken together, this literature suggests that meritocratic perceptions are systematically associated with social position and redistributive attitudes. In particular, they are associated with whether inequality is interpreted primarily as the outcome of individual performance or as a condition that warrants collective intervention.</p>
<p>Finally, meritocracy is deeply entangled with schooling, making education a crucial agent of socialization. Schools are key institutions for advancing meritocratic ideals—through evaluation, grading, selection, and credentials that signal that effort and ability should be rewarded—while also being settings in which non-meritocratic advantages (family resources, cultural capital, peer environments, and unequal school quality) remain visible and consequential <span class="citation" data-cites="batruch_belief_2022 resh_sense_2014">(<a href="#ref-batruch_belief_2022" role="doc-biblioref">Batruch et al., 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-resh_sense_2014" role="doc-biblioref">Resh &amp; Sabbagh, 2014</a>)</span>. This duality helps explain why students may endorse meritocracy as an ideal while recognizing structural constraints, a pattern highlighted in education-focused work on “dual consciousness” <span class="citation" data-cites="tang_meritocratic_2025 liu_does_2025">(<a href="#ref-liu_does_2025" role="doc-biblioref">Liu &amp; Wang, 2025</a>; <a href="#ref-tang_meritocratic_2025" role="doc-biblioref">Tang et al., 2025</a>)</span>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-socialization-of-meritocracy-families-and-schools">The socialization of meritocracy: families and schools</h2>
<p>Socialization refers to the process by which individuals internalize social norms, values, and practices, thereby acquiring the dispositions necessary to function in society. Far from being neutral, this process is rooted in structures of power and inequality. From a sociological perspective, <span class="citation" data-cites="bourdieu_sentido_2007">Bourdieu (<a href="#ref-bourdieu_sentido_2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span> conceptualizes socialization as an orientation that shapes individuals’ perceptions and actions, often unconsciously. In a complementary manner, <span class="citation" data-cites="bandura_sociallearning_1969">Bandura (<a href="#ref-bandura_sociallearning_1969" role="doc-biblioref">1969</a>)</span> emphasizes the role of social learning, through which children adopt patterns of behavior and value systems modeled by their families. Therefore, the internalization of meritocratic beliefs—such as the idea that effort and talent are the primary determinants of success—is not simply a rational decision, but the result of deep, structured, and class-dependent socialization processes.</p>
<p>During primary socialization, families certainly play a fundamental role in shaping attitudes and values, among them meritocratic orientations. Parenting practices reflect social class strategies aimed at preserving or enhancing social status <span class="citation" data-cites="bourdieu_reproduction_1990 bernstein_theoretical_2005">(<a href="#ref-bernstein_theoretical_2005" role="doc-biblioref">Bernstein, 2005</a>; <a href="#ref-bourdieu_reproduction_1990" role="doc-biblioref">Bourdieu &amp; Passeron, 1990</a>)</span>. Higher-status families tend to transmit symbolic-relational values such as autonomy, self-expression, and personal responsibility, closely aligned with the meritocratic ideals promoted in schools <span class="citation" data-cites="santanderramirez_preferencias_2020">(<a href="#ref-santanderramirez_preferencias_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Santander Ramírez et al., 2020</a>)</span>. On the other hand, families from disadvantaged backgrounds may emphasize discipline, effort, and obedience. Such values have been also linked to meritocracy, but often dissociated from the institutional resources necessary to achieve upward mobility. Through explicit discourse and lived experience, children absorb messages about success, fairness, and responsibility, which often reflect their parents’ attitudes and expectations <span class="citation" data-cites="bandura_sociallearning_1969">(<a href="#ref-bandura_sociallearning_1969" role="doc-biblioref">Bandura, 1969</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Besides families, schools play a central role in reinforcing values and beliefs through mechanisms of classification, evaluation, and public recognition. Such secondary socialization at school includes grades, awards, and distinctions function as institutional markers of “merit”, shaping students’ understanding of achievement as individually earned rather than socially conditioned <span class="citation" data-cites="resh_sense_2014">(<a href="#ref-resh_sense_2014" role="doc-biblioref">Resh &amp; Sabbagh, 2014</a>)</span>. In this context, the distinction between preferences and perceptions of meritocracy is crucial: students may endorse merit as a fair principle for distributing rewards while simultaneously doubting whether their school environment truly operates under such ideals. Previous studies show that students who affirm the importance of effort and intelligence for achieving good grades (i.e., high meritocratic preferences) are yet ambivalent about whether these criteria are fairly applied in society and school (i.e., perceptions) <span class="citation" data-cites="castillo_socialization_2024">(<a href="#ref-castillo_socialization_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Castillo et al., 2024</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The consequences of this meritocratic socialization extend beyond the classroom. On the one hand, the meritocratic framing often leads students—regardless of their social background—to attribute academic success or failure to personal effort, reinforcing individualistic explanations and limiting awareness of structural barriers <span class="citation" data-cites="darnon_where_2018">(<a href="#ref-darnon_where_2018" role="doc-biblioref">Darnon et al., 2018</a>)</span>. As <span class="citation" data-cites="lampert_meritocratic_2013">Lampert (<a href="#ref-lampert_meritocratic_2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> notes, the meritocratic school systematically rewards a minority while instilling in the majority a sense of personal failure and worthlessness. Despite this, children and adolescents—even from disadvantaged backgrounds—frequently internalize meritocratic narratives, suggesting that school-based exposure is a powerful force in shaping students’ beliefs about inequality and justice <span class="citation" data-cites="henry_development_2006">(<a href="#ref-henry_development_2006" role="doc-biblioref">Henry &amp; Saul, 2006</a>)</span>. On the other hand, students who perceive higher levels of meritocracy in their schools—particularly those who believe that effort and talent are justly rewarded—are more likely to justify unequal access to education, healthcare, and pensions based on individuals’ economic means <span class="citation" data-cites="castillo_socialization_2024">(<a href="#ref-castillo_socialization_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Castillo et al., 2024</a>)</span>. These market justice preferences reflect a broader tendency to accept or legitimize inequality as a fair outcome of differential contributions. Notably, these associations are strongest in high-status schools, where academic performance and social privilege are more prevalent. This suggests that school environments not only shape academic trajectories but also contribute to the cultural reproduction of inequality by reinforcing ideological support for market-based distributive logics. In this way, the school emerges as a central institution in the moral economy of neoliberal societies: one that not only sorts individuals by performance but also legitimates the stratification it helps to produce.</p>
</section>
<section id="this-study" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="this-study">This study</h2>
<p>Given the relevance of meritocracy during school-age as stated above, this study aims to examine how students understand meritocracy during this formative stage of socialization—schooling—and whether these understandings can be reliably and comparably measured. Building on Castillo et al.’s <span class="citation" data-cites="castillo_multidimensional_2023">(<a href="#ref-castillo_multidimensional_2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> conceptual and measurement framework, we test whether students are able to differentiate between (i) perceptions about how meritocracy actually operates in Chile (“what is”) and (ii) preferences about how it should operate (“what ought to be”), and whether these judgments distinguish meritocratic elements (effort, talent) from non-meritocratic elements (family wealth, personal contacts).</p>
<p>{&gt;&gt;<span class="citation" data-cites="Andreas-Lafferte">(<a href="#ref-Andreas-Lafferte" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>Andreas-Lafferte?</strong></a>)</span>, esto aparece repetido, está en la sección anterior de socialización, lo incorporaría ahí&lt;&lt;} Extending this framework to the school population matters for two reasons. First, schools are a central institutional arena where meritocratic ideals are publicly performed through grading, selection, tracking, and credentialing, while students are simultaneously exposed to salient non-meritocratic advantages linked to family resources and social networks <span class="citation" data-cites="mijs_inequality_2018 liu_does_2025 resh_sense_2014">(<a href="#ref-liu_does_2025" role="doc-biblioref">Liu &amp; Wang, 2025</a>; <a href="#ref-mijs_inequality_2018" role="doc-biblioref">Mijs, 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-resh_sense_2014" role="doc-biblioref">Resh &amp; Sabbagh, 2014</a>)</span>; in educational settings, these beliefs are also meaningfully connected to broader attitudes toward inequality <span class="citation" data-cites="batruch_belief_2022 wiederkehr_belief_2015">(<a href="#ref-batruch_belief_2022" role="doc-biblioref">Batruch et al., 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-wiederkehr_belief_2015" role="doc-biblioref">Wiederkehr et al., 2015</a>)</span>. Second, because beliefs about merit often crystallize early, establishing a valid measurement model in adolescence is a prerequisite for developmental and longitudinal research on how these beliefs evolve and what they predict later in life.</p>
<p>Empirically, beyond assessing factorial validity, the paper focuses on measurement stability—whether the same latent constructs are captured comparably across age cohorts and across time within the same students. Finally, we examine convergent validity by linking students’ meritocracy dimensions to market justice preferences (support for market-based access to healthcare, education, and old-age pensions). Prior research suggests that endorsing meritocratic narratives can align with broader legitimizing orientations toward inequality and market allocation <span class="citation" data-cites="castillo_socialization_2024">(<a href="#ref-castillo_socialization_2024" role="doc-biblioref">Castillo et al., 2024</a>)</span>, whereas recognizing non-meritocratic determinants of success may weaken such legitimation.</p>
