# Discussion

The present study aimed to evaluate the applicability of the multidimensional model of meritocratic beliefs (Castillo et al., 2023) among school-aged populations in Chile, distinguishing between perceptions and preferences, and assessing measurement invariance across age cohorts and over time. The findings contribute to ongoing debates on the formation, measurement, and reproduction of meritocratic beliefs in educational contexts.

First, the results provide empirical support for the four-factor structure distinguishing perceptions and preferences of meritocracy and non-meritocracy among adolescents. The overall fit indices were consistently strong in both primary and secondary school cohorts, suggesting that the multidimensional framework maintains conceptual validity beyond adult populations. This constitutes a significant extension of previous studies, as it demonstrates that even at early stages of adolescence, students are able to differentiate between how they believe society distributes rewards (perceptions) and how they think it ought to (preferences). In line with Batruch et al. (2022) and Elenbaas (2019), these findings reinforce the idea that adolescence represents a formative period during which distributive beliefs begin to crystallize around both normative ideals and lived experiences of inequality.

Second, the results point to meaningful differences between cohorts. While configural invariance was supported, further restrictions on thresholds and factor loadings indicated that scalar and strong invariance could not be established. This suggests that the interpretation of meritocratic and non-meritocratic items is not fully equivalent between primary and secondary students. In practical terms, this implies that the salience and meaning of effort, talent, wealth, and social connections shift as students progress through school. These findings resonate with previous evidence showing that schooling itself reconfigures how children understand the relationship between achievement and fairness (Dubet, 2011; Goudeau & Croizet, 2017). Rather than viewing the lack of invariance as a measurement failure, it may be interpreted as evidence of the dynamic and socially embedded nature of meritocratic beliefs—beliefs that evolve as students become increasingly exposed to evaluative practices and stratified educational trajectories.

Third, the item-level results add nuance to this interpretation. In the primary cohort, meritocratic preferences appeared more strongly tied to talent than to effort, whereas in the secondary cohort this pattern was reversed. This inversion suggests that students’ understandings of “deservingness” are not static but reweighted through schooling experiences: younger students may valorize innate ability, while older students—more embedded in competitive grading systems—place greater importance on sustained effort. These findings underscore the value of examining meritocracy not as a monolithic construct but as one continuously reinterpreted through institutional practices, family socialization, and broader cultural narratives (Henry & Saul, 2006; Resh & Sabbagh, 2014).

From a theoretical perspective, the study highlights the usefulness of distinguishing between perceptions and preferences. Consistent with the literature (Mijs, 2019; Sandel, 2020), the results reveal a gap between the normative endorsement of meritocracy and more skeptical evaluations of its realization in practice. This gap is particularly salient in the Chilean case, where a market-driven and stratified school system simultaneously fosters belief in meritocratic ideals while exposing students to daily reminders of structural inequality (Bellei, 2013; Valenzuela et al., 2013). By documenting how adolescents navigate this tension, the study contributes to a broader understanding of how system-justifying ideologies are formed and sustained.

Several limitations must also be acknowledged. The sampling strategy was non-probabilistic and geographically restricted, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Moreover, the use of short scales, while advantageous for research with adolescents, may constrain the depth of construct measurement. Future research should replicate these analyses using nationally representative samples and incorporate alternative strategies—such as experimental vignettes or implicit measures—that can capture the complexity of distributive beliefs. Longitudinal designs with additional measurement waves would also help clarify whether the observed differences between cohorts reflect developmental stages, institutional trajectories, or broader cohort effects.

In sum, this study advances the literature on meritocratic beliefs by extending a multidimensional measurement model to adolescent populations, providing evidence of both conceptual validity and developmental variation. The findings suggest that schools play a dual role in the socialization of meritocratic beliefs: they transmit ideals of fairness grounded in effort and talent, while simultaneously exposing students to inequalities that challenge these ideals. This tension may represent a key mechanism through which meritocratic beliefs are reshaped across the life course and translated into broader attitudes toward inequality and redistribution. By situating the analysis in Chile—a paradigmatic case of neoliberal educational reform—the study underscores the importance of considering institutional contexts when examining the early socialization of distributive justice beliefs.
