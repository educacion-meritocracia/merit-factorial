Chile offers a particularly informative context for this test. The country remains among the most unequal ones in Latin America and the OECD [@chancel_world_2025; @flores_top_2020], and its school system has been profoundly shaped by neoliberal reforms that organized schooling as a quasi-market [@madariaga_three_2020; @ferre_welfare_2023]. By institutionalizing school choice and public–private competition—supported by subsidies, performance incentives, and selective admission—these reforms have produced a highly stratified and segregated educational landscape [@corvalan_mercado_2017]. In such a context, both merit-based and non-merit-based explanations of achievement are likely to be socially salient: daily school experiences emphasize individual performance while social background disparities across schools and trajectories remain visible. Meritocratic narratives also remain influential in how educational communities interpret success, effort, and fairness within schools [@moyanodavila_merit_2025; @castillo_socialization_2024]. Chile, therefore, constitutes a critical case to evaluate whether adolescents distinguish perceptions from preferences and meritocratic from non-meritocratic principles, and whether these dimensions are comparable across age cohorts and over time—an essential step for understanding how schooling shapes beliefs about opportunity and inequality.

The following section develops the theoretical framework by defining meritocratic beliefs, reviewing their measurement, examining the role of schools as socializing agents, and discussing the Chilean case. We then describe the sample, procedures, measures, and analytic approach. The results sections present the measurement tests and substantive associations, and the conclusion discusses the implications for adolescents' understanding of meritocracy, the stability and comparability of these beliefs, and the scale's relationship to attitudes toward inequality.


## Antecedentes

The Chilean educational system offers a unique setting for examining the school-based socialization of meritocratic beliefs. As one of the most market-driven educational systems in the world, Chile has experienced decades of neoliberal reform that reshaped its educational landscape around principles of privatization, competition, and individual responsibility [@madariaga_three_2020; @boccardo_30_2020]. Introduced during the military dictatorship (1973-1989) and consolidated under democratic governments, this model relies on public subsidies to families, a strong presence of private providers, and mechanisms that stratify access based on socioeconomic background [@bellei_estudio_2013; @valenzuela_socioeconomic_2013]. In this context, schools are not merely sites of learning but also institutional spaces where students are exposed to—and absorb—norms of competition, performance, and accountability. These conditions not only entrench structural inequalities but also foster a cultural environment in which individual success is interpreted as the outcome of merit, obscuring the influence of unequal starting points [@dubet_repensar_2011].


## The Chilean Educational Context: Marketization and Segregation

Chile represents a paradigmatic case of neoliberal educational reform in Latin America, characterized by extensive privatization and market-based mechanisms that have profoundly shaped its educational landscape. Following reforms introduced during the civil-military dictatorship (1973–1989) and expanded throughout the democratic period, Chile developed one of the most marketized school systems globally, where access to quality education is heavily stratified by socioeconomic status and payment capacity [@boccardo_30_2020; @madariaga_three_2020]. The Chilean educational system operates through three administrative categories: public schools (30.6% of enrollment), state-subsidized private voucher schools (54.0%), and fully private schools (9.3%), with the latter predominantly serving higher-income families [@castillo_socialization_2024]. This tripartite structure emerged from the 1980s voucher reform, which introduced market competition by allowing families to choose schools and providing per-student subsidies to both public and private institutions. While intended to improve quality through competition, the system has instead reinforced socioeconomic segregation, as schools select students and families sort themselves based on ability to pay additional fees and navigate the educational marketplace [@torche_intergenerational_2014].

This institutional design has created a highly stratified educational environment where school socioeconomic composition strongly predicts both academic outcomes and student experiences. The Chilean education system exhibits severe difficulties in closing socioeconomic and cultural gaps of origin, with schools serving as sites of social reproduction rather than mobility [@bourdieu_reproduction_1990]. Despite some upward mobility into intermediate classes being feasible, access to elite educational opportunities—and subsequently elite social strata—remains largely restricted by family background [@lopez-roldan_comparative_2021; @torche_intergenerational_2014]. Within this context, meritocratic discourse has become particularly salient, with schools promoting values and narratives that emphasize individual effort and talent as the primary determinants of academic success, often obscuring the structural advantages that higher-status students bring to educational settings [@castillo_socialization_2024].

Chile's educational marketization is part of a broader pattern of neoliberal reforms that have commodified essential services across multiple domains. Following the dictatorship-era restructuring, health, pensions, and education have all become areas where provision and access are managed substantially through private entities and segmented by individual payment capacity [@boccardo_30_2020; @ffrench-davis_reformas_2018]. Despite steady economic expansion, Chile continues to rank among the most unequal nations in the OECD, with the poorest 50% receiving only 8.2% of total income while the richest 1% receives almost 27% of income and holds 36.6% of wealth [@chancel_world_2025; @flores_top_2020]. This acute economic inequality coexists with widespread belief in individual responsibility for economic outcomes—a phenomenon documented across Latin America but particularly pronounced in Chile [@bucca_merit_2016; @mac-clure_justicia_2024].

The tension between high inequality and individualistic explanations of success came to a head in October 2019, when massive social protests erupted across Chile. Initially sparked by high school students protesting transportation fare increases, the mobilizations quickly expanded to broader demands for equality of opportunities, particularly regarding access to quality education, healthcare, and pensions [@somma_no_2021]. These protests revealed deep dissatisfaction with the commodification of social services and challenged dominant meritocratic narratives, though subsequent research suggests that fundamental attitudes toward market-based distribution may have proven resilient even in the face of these collective political events [@castillo_perceptions_2025].

This highly stratified and marketized educational context provides a particularly relevant setting for examining how students develop attitudes toward economic inequality and market-based distribution. Students in Chile are socialized within institutions that simultaneously promote meritocratic ideals while operating according to market logics that explicitly segment access by payment capacity. Research indicates that Chilean students exhibit substantial support for market justice principles—justifying unequal access to healthcare, education, and pensions based on income—at rates higher than those observed in adult populations [@castillo_socialization_2024].

Understanding how the Chilean educational context shapes these attitudes requires attention to both family and school socialization processes, the role of meritocratic perceptions, and the institutional features that normalize market-based inequalities. The meritocratic framing prevalent in Chilean schools treats academic achievement as the outcome of individual effort and talent rather than as the result of differential access to resources and opportunities, potentially legitimizing broader patterns of social and economic inequality [@darnon_where_2018]. This context makes Chile an ideal case for examining the interplay between educational experiences, meritocratic beliefs, and preferences for market justice.

varias cosas que corresponden a la conclusión

From a theoretical perspective, the study highlights the usefulness of distinguishing between perceptions and preferences. Consistent with the literature @mijs_paradox_2019; @sandel_tyranny_2020], the results reveal a gap between the normative endorsement of meritocracy and more skeptical evaluations of its realization in practice. This gap is particularly salient in the Chilean case, where a market-driven and stratified school system simultaneously fosters belief in meritocratic ideals while exposing students to daily reminders of structural inequality [@bellei_estudio_2013; @valenzuela_socioeconomic_2013]. By documenting how adolescents navigate this tension, the study contributes to a broader understanding of how system-justifying ideologies are formed and sustained.

Several limitations must also be acknowledged. The sampling strategy was non-probabilistic and geographically restricted, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Moreover, the use of short scales, while advantageous for research with adolescents, may constrain the depth of construct measurement. Future research should replicate these analyses using nationally representative samples and incorporate alternative strategies—such as experimental vignettes or implicit measures—that can capture the complexity of distributive beliefs. Longitudinal designs with additional measurement waves would also help clarify whether the observed differences between cohorts reflect developmental stages, institutional trajectories, or broader cohort effects.

In sum, this study advances the literature on meritocratic beliefs by extending a multidimensional measurement model to adolescent populations, providing evidence of both conceptual validity and developmental variation. The findings suggest that schools play a dual role in the socialization of meritocratic beliefs: they transmit ideals of fairness grounded in effort and talent, while simultaneously exposing students to inequalities that challenge these ideals. This tension may represent a key mechanism through which meritocratic beliefs are reshaped across the life course and translated into broader attitudes toward inequality and redistribution. By situating the analysis in Chile—a paradigmatic case of neoliberal educational reform—the study underscores the importance of considering institutional contexts when examining the early socialization of distributive justice beliefs.


# Métodos


### Preferences for market justice

We included in ths research measures of preferences for market justice in order to assess the convergent validity of the scale. They were measured with three items capturing the extent to which respondents justify conditioning access to core services—healthcare, pensions, and education—on individual income. Each item asks whether it is fair in Chile that people with higher incomes can access better healthcare, pensions, or education than people with lower incomes. Responses were recorded on a four-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (4). We combined the three items into a composite measure of “market justice preferences," calculated as the average of these three items. This operationalization follows prior work to facilitate comparability with the existing literature [@castillo_perceptions_2025; @castillo_socialization_2024; @lindh_public_2015]. Supporting the measure's unidimensionality, an exploratory factor analysis indicated a single-factor structure, and the index showed acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach’s $\alpha$ = 0.77; details reported in the Supplementary Materials). 

### Construct validity via latent correlations

After establishing the supported level of longitudinal measurement invariance for the four-factor meritocracy scale, we evaluated construct validity by estimating latent correlations between each meritocracy dimension and a separate latent factor capturing preferences for market justice (healthcare, pensions, and education). Latent correlations—estimated at the factor level within CFA/SEM—reflect associations between constructs net of measurement error, and are commonly used as evidence of convergent and discriminant validity in measurement models. We interpreted stronger (vs. weaker) associations with market-justice preferences as supportive of convergent validity when theoretically expected, and we checked that correlations were not so large as to suggest poor discriminant validity or empirical redundancy between constructs [@kline_principles_2023; @brown_confirmatory_2015].
