# Discussion

A first area to highlight from the results is the empirical support for the four-factor structure distinguishing perceptions and preferences of meritocracy and non-meritocracy among adolescents. The overall fit indices were consistently strong in both primary and secondary school cohorts, suggesting that the multidimensional framework maintains conceptual validity beyond adult populations. This constitutes a significant extension of previous studies, as it demonstrates that even at early stages of adolescence, students are able to differentiate between how they believe society distributes rewards (perceptions) and how they think it ought to (preferences). In line with Batruch et al. [@batruch_belief_2022] and Elenbaas [@elenbaas_unfairness_2019a], these findings reinforce the idea that adolescence represents a formative period during which distributive beliefs begin to crystallize around both normative ideals and lived experiences of inequality.

Secondly, the results point to meaningful differences between students' cohorts. While configural invariance was supported, further restrictions on thresholds and factor loadings indicated that scalar and strong invariance could not be established. This suggests that the interpretation of meritocratic and non-meritocratic items is not fully equivalent between primary and secondary students. In practical terms, this implies that the salience and meaning of effort, talent, wealth, and social connections shift as students progress through school. These findings resonate with previous evidence showing that schooling itself reconfigures how children understand the relationship between achievement and fairness [@dubet_repensar_2011; @goudeau_hidden_2017a]. Rather than viewing the lack of invariance as a measurement failure, it may be interpreted as evidence of the dynamic and socially embedded nature of meritocratic beliefs, which evolve as students become increasingly exposed to evaluative practices and stratified educational trajectories.

Third, the item-level results add nuance to this interpretation. In the primary cohort, meritocratic preferences appeared more strongly tied to talent than to effort, whereas in the secondary cohort this pattern was reversed. This inversion suggests that students’ understandings of “deservingness” are not static but reassessed through schooling experiences: younger students may valorize innate ability, while older students—more embedded in competitive grading systems—place greater importance on sustained effort. These findings underscore the value of examining meritocracy not as a static construct but as one continuously reinterpreted through institutional practices, family socialization, and broader cultural narratives [@henry_development_2006; @resh_sense_2014].
