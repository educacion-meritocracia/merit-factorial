## Meritocratic perceptions and preferences

Meritocracy is often understood as a normative principle that justifies the allocation of rewards and opportunities based on effort and talent. Originally proposed by @young_rise_1958 in his dystopian novel, the concept was intended to critique a social order in which power is justified by achievement. Despite this critical origin, meritocracy has been widely accepted as a principle of equity: the idea that people should be rewarded based on their effort and talent, rather than inherited privileges. However, as @sandel_tyranny_2020 argues, the promise of meritocracy often becomes a source of inequality, as those who succeed are encouraged to believe they deserve it, while those who fail are forced to internalize the blame. Rather than mitigating inequality, meritocratic ideals can reinforce it by disguising structural disadvantage as a personal deficiency.

Recent research has emphasized the need to distinguish between meritocratic preferences and meritocratic perceptions [@castillo_multidimensional_2023]. While preferences refer to the belief that social rewards should be allocated based on merit (which should be the case), perceptions refer to the belief in how meritocracy operates in society (which is the case). This distinction allows for a more precise understanding of how people interpret inequality: they may regard merit as an ideal, while recognizing that society's institutions often fail to deliver on this promise. In stratified societies, this gap between preferences and perceptions becomes particularly evident. People may continue to normatively believe in meritocracy even in the face of evidence that opportunities are unequally distributed.

Several empirical investigations have examined the social foundations and consequences of meritocratic beliefs, particularly in adult populations. Findings consistently show that people with higher levels of education, income, and occupational prestige are more likely to endorse meritocratic explanations for social outcomes [@garcia-sanchez_perceptions_2018; @mijs_paradox_2019]. These beliefs are not merely cognitive or moral evaluations but have significant implications for how people think about fairness and redistribution. People who believe that society rewards merit are more likely to justify existing inequalities and less likely to endorse redistributive policies [@reynolds_perceptions_2014; @hauser_misperceptions_2017]. In this way, meritocratic beliefs shift responsibility for success or failure onto individuals, neglecting the role of structural factors and reinforcing the legitimacy of the status quo.

## Meritocratic perceptions and preferences at school

The Chilean educational system offers a unique setting for examining the school-based socialization of meritocratic beliefs. As one of the most market-driven educational systems in the world, Chile has experienced decades of neoliberal reform that reshaped its educational landscape around principles of privatization, competition, and individual responsibility. Introduced during the military dictatorship and consolidated under democratic governments, this model relies on public subsidies to families, a strong presence of private providers, and mechanisms that stratify access based on socioeconomic background [@bellei_estudio_2013; @valenzuela_socioeconomic_2013]. In this context, schools are not merely sites of learning but also institutional spaces where students are exposed to—and absorb—norms of competition, performance, and accountability. These conditions not only entrench structural inequalities but also foster a cultural environment in which individual success is interpreted as the outcome of merit, obscuring the influence of unequal starting points.

Central to this process is the school-based dissemination of meritocratic beliefs—understood as the idea that effort and talent should determine educational outcomes and future opportunities. In the school context, the distinction between preferences and perceptions is crucial: students may endorse merit as a fair principle for distributing rewards while simultaneously doubting whether their school environment truly operates under such ideals. Empirical studies in Chile show that students who affirm the importance of effort and intelligence for achieving good grades (i.e., high meritocratic preferences), yet they are more ambivalent about whether these criteria are fairly applied in society and school (i.e., perceptions) [@castillo_socialization_2024]. This gap reveals how the school simultaneously cultivates belief in meritocratic ideals and reproduces the very inequities that challenge their validity.

Schools play a central role in reinforcing these beliefs through mechanisms of classification, evaluation, and public recognition. Grades, awards, and distinctions function as institutional markers of “merit”, shaping students’ understanding of achievement as individually earned rather than socially conditioned [@resh_sense_2014]. This framing often leads students—regardless of their social background—to attribute academic success or failure to personal effort, reinforcing individualistic explanations and limiting awareness of structural barriers [@darnon_where_2018]. As @lampert_meritocratic_2013 notes, the meritocratic school systematically rewards a minority while instilling in the majority a sense of personal failure and worthlessness. Despite this, children and adolescents—even from disadvantaged backgrounds—frequently internalize meritocratic narratives, suggesting that school-based exposure is a powerful force in shaping students’ beliefs about inequality and justice [@henry_development_2006].

The consequences of this meritocratic socialization extend beyond the classroom. As shown by @castillo_socialization_2024, students who perceive higher levels of meritocracy in their schools—particularly those who believe that effort and talent are justly rewarded—are more likely to justify unequal access to education, healthcare, and pensions based on individuals’ economic means. These market justice preferences reflect a broader tendency to accept or legitimize inequality as a fair outcome of differential contributions. Notably, these associations are strongest in high-status schools, where academic performance and social privilege are more prevalent. This suggests that school environments not only shape academic trajectories but also contribute to the cultural reproduction of inequality by reinforcing ideological support for market-based distributive logics. In this way, the school emerges as a central institution in the moral economy of neoliberal societies: one that not only sorts individuals by performance but also legitimates the stratification it helps to produce.

## The socialization of meritocracy: families and schools

Socialization refers to the process by which individuals internalize social norms, values, and practices, thereby acquiring the dispositions necessary to function in society. Far from being neutral, this process is rooted in structures of power and inequality. From a sociological perspective, @bourdieu_sentido_2007 conceptualizes socialization as an orientation that shapes individuals' perceptions and actions, often without their conscious awareness. In a complementary manner, @bandura_sociallearning_1969 emphasizes the role of social learning, through which children adopt patterns of behavior and value systems modeled by their families. Therefore, the internalization of meritocratic beliefs—such as the idea that effort and talent are the primary determinants of success—is not simply a rational decision, but the result of deep, structured, and class-dependent socialization processes.

In schools, meritocratic socialization occurs through formal and informal mechanisms. As institutions designed to assess, classify, and organize students, schools function as microcosms of broader social structures. Through grading, awards, and disciplinary practices, students are taught to associate achievement with personal effort, often in ways that obscure the impact of social origin, economic resources, or institutional bias. In stratified, market-oriented systems, such as Chile's, schools reinforce competition and individual responsibility, naturalizing social hierarchies as the result of fair procedures. As @lahire_teoria_2012 argues, these school experiences can instill lasting dispositions, even if people are not always aware of the structural foundations of such beliefs. Consequently, schools become key spaces for the reproduction of meritocratic ideology, providing students with justifications for existing inequalities while framing them as legitimate and deserved. 

Families also play a fundamental role in shaping meritocratic orientations. Parenting practices reflect social class strategies aimed at preserving or enhancing social status [@bourdieu_reproduction_1990; @bernstein_theoretical_2005]. Higher-status families tend to transmit symbolic-relational values such as autonomy, self-expression, and personal responsibility, closely aligned with the meritocratic ideals promoted in schools [@santanderramirez_preferencias_2020]. On the other hand, families from disadvantaged backgrounds may emphasize discipline, effort, and obedience; values that are also meritocratic, but often dissociated from the institutional resources necessary to achieve upward mobility. Through explicit discourse and lived experience, children absorb messages about success, fairness, and responsibility, which often reflect their parents' attitudes and expectations [@bandura_sociallearning_1969].
