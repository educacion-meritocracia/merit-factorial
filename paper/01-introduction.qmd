# Introduction


Despite rising economic inequality and limited social mobility in contemporary societies [@chancel_world_2025; @lopez-roldan_comparative_2021], meritocratic beliefs remain remarkably high among citizens [@mijs_paradox_2019; @sandel_tyranny_2020]. Meritocracy refers to the idea that social rewards are (and should be) allocated based on effort and ability rather than social origins or connections [@young_rise_1958]. Schools, long associated with opportunity and mobility, are a prime site of early socialization of this belief: beyond achievement narrative, grading, tracking, and selection make “merit” visible and consequential [@dubet_repensar_2011; @darnon_where_2018]. However, the promise of education as an equalizer is undermined by persistent inequalities in later outcomes and by evidence that schooling often reproduces inequality through stratified and unequal learning environments [@bourdieu_reproduction_1990; @goudeau_hidden_2017a; @zhou_equalization_2019]. This tension makes schools critical arenas where meritocratic beliefs are formed and can function as an ideological lens: interpreting outcomes as fair reflections of merit can obscure structural disadvantages and legitimize hierarchies [@batruch_belief_2022; @wiederkehr_belief_2015; @lampert_meritocratic_2013; @tang_meritocratic_2025; @mijs_unfulfillable_2016]. Understanding how young people perceive and endorse these beliefs is therefore crucial for tracing early links between schooling, fairness, and inequality.

Regardless of its importance, empirical research on meritocratic beliefs remains conceptually and operationally fragmented. Measures range from broad attitudes toward mobility and inequality to implicit beliefs about success, responsibility, and structural constraints [@trump_when_2020; @castillo_meritocracia_2019]. In recent education research, studies rely on single-dimensional indicators and often conflate descriptive perceptions (how meritocracy works) with normative preferences (how it should work) [@liu_does_2025; @tang_meritocratic_2025]. A related problem concerns the incorporation of non-meritocratic logics. Even when researchers distinguish merit factors from non-merit factors (e.g., family wealth or connections), these dimensions are often collapsed into a single continuum through subtraction or reverse-coding [as did by @reynolds_perceptions_2014]. This practice embeds a zero-sum assumption that is theoretically nontrivial and empirically risky: if merit and non-merit beliefs can coexist (“dual consciousness”), increasing recognition of non-merit barriers may mechanically appear to be a decline in meritocracy [@zhu_meritocratic_2025]. In schools—where these beliefs are learned, negotiated, and reinforced—this measurement problem is especially consequential because it can distort how we interpret age differences and change over time [@batruch_belief_2022; @elenbaas_unfairness_2019a].

To move beyond these limitations, we adopt a multidimensional approach that treats perceptions and preferences, as well as meritocratic and non-meritocratic principles, as distinct dimensions. Castillo et al. [-@castillo_multidimensional_2023] proposed such a conceptual and measurement framework, which has received support in adult populations but has not yet been tested among school-aged students in everyday school contexts. Building on research on the early formation of distributive beliefs and meritocratic perceptions in schools [@batruch_belief_2022; @darnon_where_2018; @wiederkehr_belief_2015; @tang_meritocratic_2025], this paper extends Castillo et al.’s [-@castillo_multidimensional_2023] framework to early adolescence in Chile. Our research question is: Do school-aged students distinguish between meritocratic and non-meritocratic principles, and between perceptions (“what is”) and preferences (“what should be”)? Additionally, can these dimensions be measured in ways that are comparable across age cohorts and consistent over time? We argue that this conception of meritocracy clarifies what adolescents actually endorse—descriptions, ideals, or both—and provides the basis for measurement required for developmental and longitudinal inference.

Chile offers a particularly informative context for this test. Chile remains among the most unequal countries in Latin America and the OECD [@chancel_world_2025; @flores_top_2020], and its school system has been profoundly shaped by neoliberal reforms that organized schooling as a quasi-market [@madariaga_three_2020; @ferre_welfare_2023]. By institutionalizing school choice and public–private competition—supported by subsidies, performance incentives, and selective admission—these reforms have produced a highly stratified and segregated educational landscape [@corvalan_mercado_2017]. In such a context, both merit-based and non-merit-based explanations of achievement are likely to be socially salient: daily school experiences emphasize individual performance while social background disparities across schools and trajectories remain visible. Meritocratic narratives also remain influential in how educational communities interpret success, effort, and fairness within schools [@moyanodavila_merit_2025; @castillo_socialization_2024]. Chile, therefore, constitutes a critical case to evaluate whether adolescents distinguish perceptions from preferences and meritocratic from non-meritocratic principles, and whether these dimensions are comparable across age cohorts and over time—an essential step for understanding how schooling shapes beliefs about opportunity and inequality.

To address these questions, we use longitudinal survey data from school-aged students in Chile collected in 2023 and 2024. Our measurement strategy combines invariance testing (to assess comparability across age cohorts and waves) with latent correlations (to evaluate convergent validity). The following section develops the theoretical framework by defining meritocratic beliefs, reviewing their measurement, examining the role of schools as socializing agents, and discussing the Chilean case. We then describe the sample, procedures, measures, and analytic approach. The results sections present the measurement tests and substantive associations, and the conclusion discusses the implications for adolescents' understanding of meritocracy, the stability and comparability of these beliefs, and the scale's relationship to attitudes toward inequality.
