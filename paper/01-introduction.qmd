# Introduction


Despite rising economic inequality and limited social mobility in contemporary societies [@chancel_world_2025; @lopez-roldan_comparative_2021], meritocratic beliefs remain remarkably high among citizens [@mijs_paradox_2019; @sandel_tyranny_2020]. Meritocracy refers to the idea that social rewards are (and should be) allocated based on effort and ability rather than social origins or connections [@young_rise_1958]. Schools, long associated with opportunity and mobility, are a prime site of early socialization of this belief: beyond achievement narrative, grading, tracking, and selection make “merit” visible and consequential [@traini_stratification_2022; @darnon_where_2018]. However, the promise of education as an equalizer is undermined by persistent inequalities in later outcomes and by evidence that schooling often reproduces inequality through stratified and unequal learning environments [@bourdieu_reproduction_1990; @goudeau_hidden_2017a; @zhou_equalization_2019]. This tension makes schools critical arenas where meritocratic beliefs are formed and can function as an ideological lens: interpreting outcomes as fair reflections of merit can obscure structural disadvantages and legitimize hierarchies [@batruch_belief_2022; @wiederkehr_belief_2015; @lampert_meritocratic_2013; @tang_meritocratic_2025; @mijs_unfulfillable_2016]. Understanding how young people perceive and endorse these beliefs is therefore crucial for tracing early links between schooling, fairness, and inequality.

Regardless of its importance, empirical research on meritocratic beliefs remains conceptually and operationally fragmented. In studies using survey data, measures range from broad attitudes toward mobility and inequality to implicit beliefs about success, responsibility, and structural constraints [@trump_when_2020; @castillo_meritocracia_2019]. Besides, most studies rely on single-dimensional indicators and often conflate descriptive perceptions (how meritocracy works) with normative preferences (how it should work) [@liu_does_2025; @tang_meritocratic_2025]. A related problem concerns the incorporation of non-meritocratic elements. Even when researchers distinguish merit factors from non-meritocratic ones (e.g., family wealth or connections), these dimensions are often collapsed into a single continuum through subtraction or reverse-coding [as did by @reynolds_perceptions_2014]. This practice embeds a zero-sum assumption that is theoretically nontrivial and empirically risky: if merit and non-merit beliefs can coexist (“dual consciousness”), increasing recognition of non-merit barriers may mechanically appear to be a decline in meritocracy [@zhu_meritocratic_2025]. In schools — where these beliefs are learned, negotiated, and reinforced — this measurement problem is especially consequential because it can distort how we interpret age differences and change over time [@batruch_belief_2022; @elenbaas_unfairness_2019a].

To move beyond these limitations, in the present paper we test a multidimensional approach that treats perceptions and preferences, as well as meritocratic and non-meritocratic principles, as distinct dimensions. Castillo et al. [-@castillo_multidimensional_2023] proposed such a conceptual and measurement framework, which has received support in adult populations but has not yet been tested among school-aged students in everyday school contexts. Building on research on the early formation of distributive beliefs and meritocratic perceptions in schools [@batruch_belief_2022; @darnon_where_2018; @wiederkehr_belief_2015; @tang_meritocratic_2025], this paper extends a multidimensional approach to meritocratic beliefs to early adolescence. Our research question are: Do school-aged students distinguish between meritocratic and non-meritocratic principles, and between perceptions (“what is”) and preferences (“what should be”)? Additionally, Can these dimensions be measured in ways that are comparable across age cohorts and consistent over time? We argue that this conception of meritocracy clarifies what adolescents actually endorse—descriptions, ideals, or both—and provides the basis for measurement required for developmental and longitudinal inference. For this, we use novel survey data to implement measurement invariance for  evaluating the stability and comparability of meritocratic beliefs across two age cohorts (8th and 10th graders) and two waves (2023 and 2024).
