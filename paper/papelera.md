Chile offers a particularly informative context for this test. The country remains among the most unequal ones in Latin America and the OECD [@chancel_world_2025; @flores_top_2020], and its school system has been profoundly shaped by neoliberal reforms that organized schooling as a quasi-market [@madariaga_three_2020; @ferre_welfare_2023]. By institutionalizing school choice and public–private competition—supported by subsidies, performance incentives, and selective admission—these reforms have produced a highly stratified and segregated educational landscape [@corvalan_mercado_2017]. In such a context, both merit-based and non-merit-based explanations of achievement are likely to be socially salient: daily school experiences emphasize individual performance while social background disparities across schools and trajectories remain visible. Meritocratic narratives also remain influential in how educational communities interpret success, effort, and fairness within schools [@moyanodavila_merit_2025; @castillo_socialization_2024]. Chile, therefore, constitutes a critical case to evaluate whether adolescents distinguish perceptions from preferences and meritocratic from non-meritocratic principles, and whether these dimensions are comparable across age cohorts and over time—an essential step for understanding how schooling shapes beliefs about opportunity and inequality.

The following section develops the theoretical framework by defining meritocratic beliefs, reviewing their measurement, examining the role of schools as socializing agents, and discussing the Chilean case. We then describe the sample, procedures, measures, and analytic approach. The results sections present the measurement tests and substantive associations, and the conclusion discusses the implications for adolescents' understanding of meritocracy, the stability and comparability of these beliefs, and the scale's relationship to attitudes toward inequality.
