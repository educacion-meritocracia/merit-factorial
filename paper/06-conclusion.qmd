# Conclusion

This study validates the multidimensional model of meritocratic beliefs among school-age youth in Chile, demonstrating that adolescents can clearly distinguish between how rewards are actually distributed (perceptions) and how they should be distributed (preferences). Evidence provided by the longitudinal invariance test suggests that these constructs are psychometrically robust and stable in individuals over time. This confirms that, even in early adolescence, students have a crystallized understanding of distributive justice that can be used to track the long-term impact of educational socialization.

A key finding is the “meritocratic paradox”: students recognize the significant influence of structural advantages, such as family wealth and social connections, but continue to defend effort as the main normative ideal. In the Chilean school system, characterized by commodification and segregation, this disconnect suggests that meritocratic narratives may function as an ideology that justifies the system. By maintaining belief in the ideal of merit despite recognizing a non-meritocratic reality, students may inadvertently legitimize structural inequalities, internalizing academic outcomes as personal failures rather than systemic results.

The lack of invariance across groups reveals a significant change in development, as the balance between talent and effort is reconfigured during the transition to secondary education. This suggests that schools are active agents of socialization that reshape the “moral economy” of success in response to increased institutional competition. Ultimately, these results underscore how educational experience provides the ideological framework that underpins broader patterns of disparity. As Chile grapples with demands for structural reform, understanding how these early beliefs are formed remains crucial to addressing the cultural reproduction of inequality.

For future studies, it is relevant to apply this measurement model in new cases and diverse institutional settings to test its generalization beyond the current sample. Researchers should explore how these meritocratic dimensions relate to market justice preferences—such as attitudes toward the privatization of healthcare and pensions—to determine whether school socialization directly predicts broader political orientations. Furthermore, the incorporation of experimental vignettes or qualitative interviews could clarify why students continue to endorse the ideal of “effort” despite recognizing that “connections” are an important factor for success. Finally, future longitudinal designs should extend beyond two waves to capture the impact of high-risk transitions, such as access to higher education, on the stability of these distributional beliefs.
