# Theoretical and empirical background

## Meritocratic perceptions and preferences

Meritocracy refers to a distributive system in which individual merit—typically defined as effort and talent—is treated as the primary criterion for allocating resources and rewards, rather than social origins or inherited privilege [@young_rise_1958; @bell_equality_1972]. While @young_rise_1958 coined the term as a dystopian critique of a society that justifies power and status through “achievement,” it has since been re-appropriated as a positive ideal of fairness, especially in liberal and market-oriented societies [@dubet_repensar_2011; @mijs_paradox_2019; @vandewerfhorst_meritocracy_2024]. From a sociological standpoint, meritocracy is not only a cognitive judgement about how inequality works; it is also a moral lens through which people interpret differences in income, status, and life chances [@castillo_meritocracia_2019]. Precisely because it frames outcomes as earned, meritocratic ideals can end up reinforcing inequality: “winners” are encouraged to see their position as deserved, while “losers” are pushed toward self-blame rather than structural critique [@wilson_role_2003; @mijs_stratified_2016; @sandel_tyranny_2020]. The key point is that meritocracy often promises to mitigate inherited advantage, but in practice, it can legitimize unequal structures by translating social privilege into individualized narratives of deservingness.

A significant limitation in the extant literature is the way “meritocratic beliefs” have been measured in survey studies. As @castillo_multidimensional_2023 argues, most research relies on item batteries that assess the importance of effort, talent, family background, networks, or luck for “getting ahead” and then reduces these factors to a single score. This becomes especially problematic when researchers construct a difference or continuum measure—treating meritocratic and non-meritocratic explanations as opposite ends of the same scale (e.g., by subtracting “non-merit” from “merit,” as in the @reynolds_perceptions_2014 approach). The underlying assumption is that endorsing merit must imply rejecting structural or relational advantages, leaving the possibility of the coexistence of apparently opposed beliefs out of empirical test. Recent work has explicitly raised this issue: @liu_does_2025 emphasizes that meritocratic endorsement may be stable while recognition of structural constraints changes; @tang_meritocratic_2025 motivates “dual consciousness” but still risks obscuring it when operationalizations force relative trade-offs; and @zhu_meritocratic_2025 argues directly that meritocratic and structural explanations are not zero-sum, but often accumulate rather than replace one another. The measurement implication is essential but straightforward: if people can simultaneously believe that effort matters and that family resources or connections matter, then unidimensional indices (and especially subtraction scores) can manufacture artificial “neutral” positions and blur substantively distinct belief profiles.

@castillo_multidimensional_2023 address these problems by decomposing “meritocratic beliefs” along two analytically independent axes: preferences versus perceptions, and meritocratic versus non-meritocratic allocation principles. Preferences capture normative ideals about how rewards should be distributed (e.g., whether effort and ability ought to determine life chances). In contrast, perceptions capture descriptive evaluations of how society actually works (e.g., whether observed inequalities reflect merit-based processes) [@janmaat_subjective_2013]. In parallel, the framework conceptualizes meritocratic elements (e.g., effort, talent) and non-meritocratic elements (e.g., social origins, inherited privilege, networks) as distinct components rather than as opposite poles of a single continuum. This yields four non-redundant constructs—meritocratic preferences, meritocratic perceptions, non-meritocratic preferences, and non-meritocratic perceptions—thus allowing combinations that older measures tend to collapse, such as endorsing meritocracy as an ideal while recognizing the weight of family background and connections. A practical advantage of this instrument is its minimalist design, which makes it well-suited for large-scale surveys with limited questionnaire space; however, this parsimony entails a trade-off, as each factor is measured with only two items, potentially constraining reliability and content coverage relative to longer batteries. In the adult population in Chile, the authors show that respondents differentiate among these dimensions and that these dimensions are systematically related; for instance, stronger perceptions that non-meritocratic factors are rewarded tend to co-occur with stronger preferences for meritocratic allocation. This configuration aligns with Zhu's [-@zhu_meritocratic_2025] “dual consciousness,” here specified as the coexistence of (a) meritocratic and non-meritocratic beliefs and (b) legitimacy judgments (“should”) alongside descriptive assessments (“is”).

Research in adult populations has mapped both the determinants and consequences of meritocratic perceptions. On the “causes” side, higher-status individuals —those with more education, income, and occupational prestige—and upward mobile individuals are consistently more likely to endorse merit-based explanations for social outcomes [@duru-bellat_whos_2012; @garcia-sanchez_perceptions_2018; @mijs_belief_2022; @traini_climbing_2025]. On the “consequences” side, perceiving one’s society as meritocratic is associated with lower support for redistribution and egalitarian policies [@hoyt_mindsets_2023; @tejero-peregrina_perceived_2025; @paneda-fernandez_relevance_2026], as well as greater acceptance of inequality and market-based allocation logics [@castillo_meritocracia_2019; @castillo_perceptions_2025]. Experimental evidence is consistent with a causal pathway in which exposure to upward-mobility information or “self-made” narratives reduces redistributive support and increases tolerance of inequality and system-justifying orientations, whereas exposure to low or downward mobility produces the opposite pattern—effects that are often partly mediated by strengthened meritocratic perceptions [@deng_its_2025; @matamoros-lima_social_2025]. Taken together, this literature suggests that meritocratic perceptions are systematically associated with social position and redistributive attitudes. In particular, they are associated with whether inequality is interpreted primarily as the outcome of individual performance or as a condition that warrants collective intervention.

Finally, meritocracy is deeply entangled with schooling, making education a crucial agent of socialization. Schools are key institutions for advancing meritocratic ideals—through evaluation, grading, selection, and credentials that signal that effort and ability should be rewarded—while also being settings in which non-meritocratic advantages (family resources, cultural capital, peer environments, and unequal school quality) remain visible and consequential [@batruch_belief_2022; @resh_sense_2014]. This duality helps explain why students may endorse meritocracy as an ideal while recognizing structural constraints, a pattern highlighted in education-focused work on “dual consciousness” [@tang_meritocratic_2025; @liu_does_2025]. 

## The socialization of meritocracy: families and schools

Socialization refers to the process by which individuals internalize social norms, values, and practices, thereby acquiring the dispositions necessary to function in society. Far from being neutral, this process is rooted in structures of power and inequality. From a sociological perspective, @bourdieu_sentido_2007 conceptualizes socialization as an orientation that shapes individuals' perceptions and actions, often unconsciously. In a complementary manner, @bandura_sociallearning_1969 emphasizes the role of social learning, through which children adopt patterns of behavior and value systems modeled by their families. Therefore, the internalization of meritocratic beliefs—such as the idea that effort and talent are the primary determinants of success—is not simply a rational decision, but the result of deep, structured, and class-dependent socialization processes.

During primary socialization, families certainly play a fundamental role in shaping attitudes and values, among them meritocratic orientations. Parenting practices reflect social class strategies aimed at preserving or enhancing social status [@bourdieu_reproduction_1990; @bernstein_theoretical_2005]. Higher-status families tend to transmit symbolic-relational values such as autonomy, self-expression, and personal responsibility, closely aligned with the meritocratic ideals promoted in schools [@santanderramirez_preferencias_2020]. On the other hand, families from disadvantaged backgrounds may emphasize discipline, effort, and obedience. Such values have been also linked to meritocracy, but often dissociated from the institutional resources necessary to achieve upward mobility. Through explicit discourse and lived experience, children absorb messages about success, fairness, and responsibility, which often reflect their parents' attitudes and expectations [@bandura_sociallearning_1969].

Besides families, schools play a central role in reinforcing values and beliefs through mechanisms of classification, evaluation, and public recognition. Such secondary socialization at school includes grades, awards, and distinctions function as institutional markers of “merit”, shaping students’ understanding of achievement as individually earned rather than socially conditioned [@resh_sense_2014]. In this context, the distinction between preferences and perceptions of meritocracy is crucial: students may endorse merit as a fair principle for distributing rewards while simultaneously doubting whether their school environment truly operates under such ideals. Previous studies show that students who affirm the importance of effort and intelligence for achieving good grades (i.e., high meritocratic preferences) are yet ambivalent about whether these criteria are fairly applied in society and school (i.e., perceptions) [@castillo_socialization_2024]. 

The consequences of this meritocratic socialization extend beyond the classroom. On the one hand, the meritocratic framing often leads students—regardless of their social background—to attribute academic success or failure to personal effort, reinforcing individualistic explanations and limiting awareness of structural barriers [@darnon_where_2018]. As @lampert_meritocratic_2013 notes, the meritocratic school systematically rewards a minority while instilling in the majority a sense of personal failure and worthlessness. Despite this, children and adolescents—even from disadvantaged backgrounds—frequently internalize meritocratic narratives, suggesting that school-based exposure is a powerful force in shaping students’ beliefs about inequality and justice [@henry_development_2006]. On the other hand, students who perceive higher levels of meritocracy in their schools—particularly those who believe that effort and talent are justly rewarded—are more likely to justify unequal access to education, healthcare, and pensions based on individuals’ economic means [@castillo_socialization_2024]. These market justice preferences reflect a broader tendency to accept or legitimize inequality as a fair outcome of differential contributions. Notably, these associations are strongest in high-status schools, where academic performance and social privilege are more prevalent. This suggests that school environments not only shape academic trajectories but also contribute to the cultural reproduction of inequality by reinforcing ideological support for market-based distributive logics. In this way, the school emerges as a central institution in the moral economy of neoliberal societies: one that not only sorts individuals by performance but also legitimates the stratification it helps to produce.


## This study

Given the relevance of meritocracy during school-age as stated above, this study aims to examine how students understand meritocracy during this formative stage of socialization—schooling—and whether these understandings can be reliably and comparably measured. Building on Castillo et al.’s [-@castillo_multidimensional_2023] conceptual and measurement framework, we test whether students are able to differentiate between (i) perceptions about how meritocracy actually operates in Chile (“what is”) and (ii) preferences about how it should operate (“what ought to be”), and whether these judgments distinguish meritocratic elements (effort, talent) from non-meritocratic elements (family wealth, personal contacts). 

{>>@Andreas-Lafferte, esto aparece repetido, está en la sección anterior de socialización, lo incorporaría ahí<<}
Extending this framework to the school population matters for two reasons. First, schools are a central institutional arena where meritocratic ideals are publicly performed through grading, selection, tracking, and credentialing, while students are simultaneously exposed to salient non-meritocratic advantages linked to family resources and social networks [@mijs_inequality_2018; @liu_does_2025; @resh_sense_2014]; in educational settings, these beliefs are also meaningfully connected to broader attitudes toward inequality [@batruch_belief_2022; @wiederkehr_belief_2015]. Second, because beliefs about merit often crystallize early, establishing a valid measurement model in adolescence is a prerequisite for developmental and longitudinal research on how these beliefs evolve and what they predict later in life.

Empirically, beyond assessing factorial validity, the paper focuses on measurement stability—whether the same latent constructs are captured comparably across age cohorts and across time within the same students. Finally, we examine convergent validity by linking students’ meritocracy dimensions to market justice preferences (support for market-based access to healthcare, education, and old-age pensions). Prior research suggests that endorsing meritocratic narratives can align with broader legitimizing orientations toward inequality and market allocation [@castillo_socialization_2024], whereas recognizing non-meritocratic determinants of success may weaken such legitimation.

### Hypotheses

**$H_1$ (Dimensional differentiation)**. Students’ meritocratic beliefs are best represented by four distinct factors: perceived meritocracy, perceived non-meritocracy, preferred meritocracy, and preferred non-meritocracy.

**$H_2$ (Between-cohort measurement invariance)**. The four-factor model of meritocratic beliefs is invariant across age cohorts.

**$H_3$ (Longitudinal measurement invariance)**. The four-factor model of meritocratic beliefs is invariant across waves within students.

**$H_4$ (Convergent validity)**. Market justice preferences regarding healthcare, education, and old-age pensions are positively associated with perceived meritocracy and with preferred meritocratic and non-meritocratic principles, and negatively associated with perceived non-meritocracy.
